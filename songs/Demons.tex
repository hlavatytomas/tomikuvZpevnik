When the da\[C]ys are cold\brk
And the car\[G]ds all fold\brk
And the sai\[Am]nts we see\brk
Are all ma\[F]de of gold\brk
When your d\[C]reams all fail\brk
And the one\[G]s we hail\brk
Are the wor\[Am]st of all\brk
And the bl\[F]ood's run stale\brk
\[C]I wanna hide the tr\[G]uth\brk
I wanna shelter \[Am]you\brk
But with the beast \[F]inside\brk
There's nowhere we can \[C]hide\brk
No matter what we \[G]breed\brk
We still are made of \[Am]greed\brk
This is my kingdom \[F]come\brk
This is my kingdom \[C]come\brk

\beginchorus
\[C]When you feel my he\[G]at\brk
Look into my \[Am]eyes\brk
It's where my demons \[F]hide\brk
It's where my demons \[C]hide\brk
Don't get too \[G]close\brk
It's dark in\[Am]side\brk
It's where my demons \[F]hide\brk
It's where my demons \[C]hide\brk

When the cu\[C]rtain's call\brk
Is the last\[G] of all\brk
When the li\[Am]ghts fade out\brk
All the si\[F]nners crawl\brk
So they du\[C]g your grave\brk
And the mas\[G]querade\brk
Will come c\[Am]alling out\brk
At the mes\[F]s you made\brk
\[C]Don't wanna let you do\[G]wn\brk
But I am hell \[Am]bound\brk
Though this is all for \[F]you\brk
Don't wanna hide the \[C]truth\brk
No matter what we \[G]breed\brk
We still are made of \[Am]greed\brk
This is my kingdom \[F]come\brk
This is my kingdom \[C]come\brk

\[C]They say it's what you ma\[G]ke\brk
I say it's up to \[Am]fate\brk

Unless you show me \[C]how\brk
