}\endverse
\beginverse
\[A]Sally called when she got the word.\brk
\[D]And she said: "I suppose you've heard \[E]- about \[A]Alice".\[E]
Well, \[A]I rushed to the window, and I looked outside,          \brk
\[D]and I could hardly believe my eyes.\brk
\[E]The big limousine rolled up, into Al\[A]ice's drive.   \[E]         \brk
\endverse
\beginchorus
Oh, I \[A]don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go.\brk
I \[D]guess she's got her reasons, but I just don't wanna know.\brk
'Cause for \[E]twenty-four years I've been living next door to \[A]Alice. \[E]         \brk
\[A]Twenty-four years just waiting for a chance,\brk
to \[D]tell her how I feel, and maybe get a second glance,\brk
now I \[E]gotta get used to not \[D]living next door to \[A]Alice. \[E]         \brk
\endchorus
\beginverse
We \[A]grew up together, two kids in the park.\brk
\[D]We carved our initials, deep in the bark.   \[E]Me and Al\[A]ice    \[E]         \brk
Now \[A]she walks through the door with her head held high\brk
\[D]Just for a moment I caught her eye\brk
\[E]As the big limousine pulled slowly out of A\[A]lice's drive   \[E]         \brk
\endverse
\beginchorus
Oh, I \[A]don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go.\brk
I \[D]guess she's got her reasons, but I just don't wanna know.\brk
'Cause for \[E]twenty-four years I've been living next door to \[A]Alice. \[E]         \brk
\[A]Twenty-four years just waiting for a chance,\brk
to \[D]tell her how I feel, and maybe get a second glance,\brk
now I \[E]gotta get used to not \[D]living next door to \[A]Alice. \[E]         \brk
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[A]Then Sally called back and asked how I felt,\brk                              
  \[D]And she said: "I know how to help \[E]- get \[A]over \[E]Alice".
She said:  Alice is gone, but I'm still here,              \[A]         \brk
you \[D]know I've been waiting for twenty-four    And the big limousine disappeared...\brk
\endverse
\beginchorus
I \[A]don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go.\brk
I \[D]guess she's got her reasons, but I just don't wanna know.\brk
'Cause for \[E]twenty-four years I've been living next door to \[A]Alice. \[E]         \brk
\[A]Twenty-four years just waiting for a chance,\brk
to \[D]tell her how I feel, and maybe get a second glance,\brk
But I'll \[E]never get used to not \[D]living next door to \[A]Alice.\brk
No, I'll \[E]never get used to not \[D]living next door to \[A]Alice...[/tab]quot;,quo\brk
