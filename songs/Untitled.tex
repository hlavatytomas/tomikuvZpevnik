I o\[Em]pen my eyes\brk
I try to see but I'm blinded by the w\[G]hite light\brk
I can't r\[Em]emember how\brk
I can't r\[Em]emember why\brk
I'm ly\[G]ing here tonig\[D]ht\brk
And I \[C]can't stand the \[D]pain\brk
And I \[Em]can't make it go \[G]away\brk
No I \[C]can't stand the \[D]pain\brk
\endverse
\beginchorus
How could this happen to \[G]me\brk
I made my mist\[Em]akes\brk
I've got no where to \[C]run\brk
The night goes \[D]on\brk
As I'm fading \[G]away\brk
I'm sick of this l\[Em]ife\brk
I just wanna s\[C]cream\brk
How could this h\[D]appen to \[G]me\brk
\endchorus
\beginverse
E\[Em]verybody's screaming\brk
I try to make a sound but no one h\[G]ears me\brk
I'm s\[Em]lipping off the edge\brk
I w\[G]anna start this over \[D]again\brk
So \[C]I try to h\[D]old onto a t\[Em]ime when no\[G]thing mattered\brk
And \[C]I can't exp\[D]lain what happened\brk
And \[Em]I can't e\[G]rase the things that I've d\[C]one\brk
No I c\[D]an't\brk
