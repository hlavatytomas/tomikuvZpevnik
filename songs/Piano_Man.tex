It's \[C]nine o'\[G]clock on a \[F]Satur\[C]day\brk
The \[F]regular \[C]crowd shuffles \[D7]in \[G]         \brk
There's an \[C]old man \[G]sitting \[F]next to \[C]me\brk
Making \[F]love to his \[G]tonic and \[C]gin \[G]         \brk
He says,  \[C]can you play \[G]me a memor\[F]y   \[C]         \brk
I'm \[F]not really \[C]sure how it \[D7]goes\[G]\brk
But it's \[C]sad and it's \[G]sweet and I \[F]knew it com\[C]plete\brk
\[F]When I wore a \[G]younger man's \[C]clothes."

And \[F]you've got us all \[G]feeling al\[C]right \[G]         \brk
\endchorus
\beginverse
Now \[C]John at the \[G]bar is a \[F]friend of \[C]mine\brk
He \[F]gets me my \[C]drinks for \[D7]free\[G]\brk
And he's \[C]quick with a \[G]joke and he'll \[F]light up your \[C]smoke\brk
But there's \[F]some place that \[G]he'd rather \[C]be  \[G]         \brk
\[C]He says, \[G]"Bill, I believe \[F]this is killing \[C]me."\brk
\[F]As the smile \[C]ran away from his \[D7]face\[G]\brk
\[C]"Well I'm \[G]sure that \[F]I could be a \[C]movie star

\beginverse*{
If \[F]I could get \[G]out of this \[C]place"

Now \[C]Paul is a \[G]real estate \[F]nove\[C]list\brk
Who \[F]never had \[C]time for a \[D7]wife\brk

And \[F]probably will \[G]be for \[C]life\brk
And the \[C]waitress is \[G]practicing \[F]poli\[C]tics\brk
As the \[F]businessman \[C]slowly gets \[D7]stoned\brk
Yes, they're \[C]sharing a \[G]drink they call \[F]loneli\[C]ness\brk

\beginverse
It's a \[C]pretty good \[G]crowd for a \[F]Satur\[C]day\brk
And the \[F]manager \[C]gives me a \[D7]smile \[G]         \brk
'Cause he \[C]knows that it's \[G]me they've been \[F]coming to \[C]see\brk
To \[F]forget about \[G]life for a w\[C]hile\brk
And the \[C]piano, it \[G]sounds like a \[F]carni\[C]val\brk
And the \[F]microphone \[C]smells like a \[D7]beer\brk
And they \[C]sit at the \[G]bar and put \[F]bread in my \[C]jar\brk
