\beginverse*{\nolyrics Intro: \[C] \[D] \[G] \[Em]\brk
}\endverse
\beginverse
I used to \[C]rule the \[D]world\brk
Seas would \[G]rise when I gave the \[Em]word\brk
Now in the morning I \[C]sleep a\[D]lone\brk
Sweep the \[G]streets I used to \[Em]own\brk
\[C] \[D] \[G] \[Em]\brk
\endverse
\beginverse
I used to \[C]roll the \[D]dice\brk
Feel the \[G]fear in my enemy's \[Em]eyes\brk
Listen as the \[C]crowd would \[D]sing:\brk
One minut\[G]e I held the key                                                         \[C]        \[D]\brk
Next the \[G]walls were closed on \[Em]me\brk
And I discovered that my \[C]castles \[D]stand\brk
Upon \[G]pillars of salt and pill\[Em]ars of sand\brk
\endverse
\beginchorus
I \[C]hear Jerusalem \[D]bells are ringing\brk
\[G]Roman Cavalry \[Em]choirs are singing\brk
\[C]Be my mirror, my \[D]sword, and shield\brk
My \[G]missionaries in a \[Em]foreign field\brk
\[C]For some reason I \[D]can't explain\brk
\[G]Once you go there was \[Em]never, never an \[C]honest \[D]word\brk
That was \[Bm]when I ruled the \[Em]world\brk
\[C] \[D] \[G] \[Em]\brk
\endchorus
\beginverse
It was the wicked and \[C]wild \[D]wind\brk
Blew down the \[G]doors to let me \[Em]in.\brk
Shattered windows and the \[C]sound of \[D]drums\brk
People \[G]couldn't believe what \[Em]I'd become\brk
Revolutio\[C]naries \[D]wait\brk
For my \[G]head on a silver \[Em]plate\brk
Just a puppet on a \[C]lonely \[D]string\brk
Oh \[G]who would ever want to be \[Em]king?\brk
\endverse
\beginchorus
I \[C]hear Jerusalem \[D]bells are ringing\brk
\[G]Roman Cavalry \[Em]choirs are singing\brk
\[C]Be my mirror, my \[D]sword, and shield\brk
My \[G]missionaries in a \[Em]foreign field\brk
\[C]For some reason I \[D]can't explain\brk
I \[G]know Saint Peter won't \[Em]call my name,\brk
never an \[C]honest \[D]word\brk
But that was \[Bm]when I ruled the \[Em]world\brk
Oh\[C]hhhh\[D]h  Oh\[G]hhhh\[Em]hh\brk
Oh\[C]hhhh\[D]h  Oh\[G]hhhh\[Em]hh\brk
