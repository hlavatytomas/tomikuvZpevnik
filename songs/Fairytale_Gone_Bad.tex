\beginverse
\[Am]This is the end you \[F]know\brk
\[C]Lady, the plans we had went all wrong\brk
\[G]We ain't nothin\[Dsus]g but fight and shout and\[Am] tears\brk
\[Am]We got to a point I can't s\[F]tand\brk
\[C]I've had it to the limit. I can't be your man\brk
\[G]I ain't more than \[Dsus]a minute away from w\[Am]alking\brk
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[F]We can't\[C] cry \[G]the pain\[F] away\brk
We can'\[C]t find\[G] a need \[F]to stay\brk
I slowly rea\[C]lized \[G]there'\[F]s nothing on our \[G]side\brk
\endchorus
\beginchorus
\[Am]Out of my life, Out of my m\[F]ind\brk
Out of the tears we can'\[G]t deny\brk
We need to swa\[C]llow all our pri\[F]de\brk
And leave this m\[G]ess behind\brk
\[Am]Out of my head, Out of my b\[F]ed\brk
Out of the dreams we had, they'\[G]re bad\brk
Tell them it'\[C]s me who made y\[F]ou sad\brk
Tell them the f\[G]airytale gone \[Am]bad\brk
\endchorus
\beginverse
Another night and I bleed
They all make mistakes and so did we
But we did something we can never turn back right
Find a new one to fool
Leave and don't look back. I won't follow
We have nothing left. It's the end of our time
\endverse
\beginchorus
We can't cry the pain away
We can't find a need to stay
There's no more rabbits in my hat to make things right
\endchorus
\beginchorus
\[Am]Out of my life, Out of my m\[F]ind\brk

And leave this m\[G]ess behind\brk
\[Am]Out of my head, Out of my b\[F]ed\brk
