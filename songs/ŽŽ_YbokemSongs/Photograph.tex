Loving can \[C]hurt\brk
Loving can \[Am]hurt sometimes\brk
But it's \[G]the only thing that I \[F]know\brk
When it gets \[C]hard\brk
you know it can get \[Am]hard sometimes\brk
it is the \[G]only thing that makes us feel ali\[F]ve\brk
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[Am]We keep this love in a photog\[F]raph\brk
\[C]We made these memories f\[G]or ourselves\brk
where our \[Am]eyes are never closing\brk
our h\[F]earts are never broken\brk
and t\[C]ime's forever froz\[G]en still\brk
\endchorus
\beginchorus
So you can \[C]keep me inside the pocket of your\brk
\[G]ripped jeans holding me close until our\brk

Wait for me to come home\brk

\beginverse
Loving can \[C]heal\brk
Loving can m\[Am]end your soul\brk
And it's \[G]the only thing that I kn\[F]ow, know\brk

remember that with every pie\[Am]ce of ya\brk
And it's \[G]the only thing we take with us when w\[F]e die\brk

Or you can f\[C]it me inside the necklace you got when you were\brk
\[G]sixteen next to your heart beat where I \brk
\[Am]should be, keep it deep within your s\[F]oul\brk
And if you \[C]hurt me well that's ok baby, only\brk
\[G]words bleed inside these pages you just\brk
\[Am]hold me and I won't ever let \[F]you go\brk
And when I'\[C]m away I will remember how you\brk
\[G]kissed me under the lamppost back on s\[Am]ixth Street\brk
hearing you whisper through the p\[F]hone\brk
