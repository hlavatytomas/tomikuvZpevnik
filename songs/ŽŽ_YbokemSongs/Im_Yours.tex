\beginverse
Well \[C]you done done me, and you bet I felt it\brk
I tr\[G]ied to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted\brk
I f\[Am]ell right through the cracks\brk
And now I'm t\[F]rying to get back\brk
Before the c\[C]ool done run out I'll be givin' it my bestest\brk
And n\[G]othing's gonna stop me but divine intervention\brk
I r\[Am]eckon it's again my turn\brk
To w\[F]in some or learn some\brk
\endverse

\[C]So I won't hesit\[G]ate\brk
No more, no m\[Am]ore\brk
It cannot w\[F]ait\brk
There's \[C]no need to compl\[G]icate our time\brk
Is s\[Am]hort\brk
This is our f\[F]ate\brk
D-d-do do you,\[G] but do you, d-d-do\brk
\[Am]But do you want to co\[G]me on\brk
Scooch on over c\[F]loser dear\brk

\beginverse
I've been spendi\[C]ng way too long\brk
And \[G]bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer\brk
But \[Am]my breath fogged up the glass\brk
And so I d\[F]rew a new face and I laughed\brk
I g\[C]uess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason\brk
To r\[G]id yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons\brk
It's \[Am]what we aim to do\brk
Our n\[F]ame is our virtue\brk
