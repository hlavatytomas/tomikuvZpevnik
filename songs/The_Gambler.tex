\sclearpage\beginsong{The Gambler}[by={Kenny Rogers}]
\beginverse
On a \[G]warm summer's evenin' on a \[C]train bound for \[G]nowhere,\brk
I \[C]met up with the \[G]gambler; we were \[C]both too tired to \[D]sleep.\brk
So \[G]we took turns a starin' out the \[C]window at the \[G]darkness\brk
'til \[C]boredom over\[G]took us, \[D]and he began to \[G]speak.\brk
\endverse
\beginverse
He said, \[G] I've made a life out of readi\[C]n' people's faces\[G],\brk
and \[C]knowin' what their \[G]cards were by the \[C]way they held their \[D]eyes.\brk
And if \[G]you don't mind my sayin', I can \[C]see you're out of \[G]aces.\brk
For a \[C]taste of your \[G]whiskey I'll \[D]give you some \[G]advice\brk
\endverse
\beginverse
So I \[G]handed him my bottle and he \[C]drank down my last \[G]swallow. \brk
\[C]Then he bummed a \[G]cigarette and \[C]asked me for a \[D]light.\brk
And the \[G]night got deathly quiet, and his \[C]face lost all expr\[G]ession.\brk
Said,  you're gon\[C]na play the game, boy\[G], ya gotta lea\[D]rn to play it rig\[G]ht.\brk
\endverse
\beginchorus
You got to \[G]know when to hold 'em,\[C] know when to \[G]fold 'em,\brk
\[C]know when to \[G]walk away \[C]and know when to \[D]run.\brk
You never \[G]count your money when you're \[C]sittin' at the \[G]table.\brk
There'll be time \[C]enough for \[G]countin' \[D]when the dealin's \[G]done.\brk
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[G]Ev'ry gambler knows that the s\[C]ecret to survi\[G]vin'\brk
is \[C]knowin' what to \[G]throw away and \[C]knowing what to \[D]keep.\brk
'Cause \[G]ev'ry hand's a winner and \[C]ev'ry hand's a \[G]loser,\brk
and the \[C]best that you can \[G]hope for is to \[D]die in your \[G]sleep.\brk
\endverse
\beginverse
And \[G]when he'd finished speakin', he \[C]turned back towards the \[G]window,\brk
\[C]crushed out his \[G]cigarette and \[C]faded off to \[D]sleep.\brk
And \[G]somewhere in the darkness the \[C]gambler, he broke \[G]even.\brk
But \[C]in his final \[G]words I found an \[D]ace that I could \[G]keep.\brk
\endverse
\beginchorus
You got to \[G]know when to hold 'em,\[C] know when to \[G]fold 'em,\brk
\[C]know when to \[G]walk away \[C]and know when to \[D]run.\brk
You never \[G]count your money when you're \[C]sittin' at the \[G]table.\brk
There'll be time \[C]enough for \[G]countin' \[D]when the dealin's \[G]done.\brk
You got to \[G]know when to hold 'em,\[C] know when to \[G]fold 'em,\brk
\[C]know when to \[G]walk away \[C]and know when to \[D]run.\brk
You never \[G]count your money when you're \[C]sittin' at the \[G]table.\brk
There'll be time \[C]enough for \[G]countin' \[D]when the dealin's \[G]done.\brk
You got to \[G]know when to hold 'em,\[C] know when to \[G]fold 'em,\brk
\[C]know when to \[G]walk away \[C]and know when to \[D]run.\brk
You never \[G]count your money when you're \[C]sittin' at the \[G]table.\brk
There'll be time \[C]enough for \[G]countin' \[D]when the dealin's \[G]
