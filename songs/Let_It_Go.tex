\beginverse
The \[Em]snow glows white on the \[C]mountain tonight\brk
Not a \[D]footprint to be \[Asus4]seen    \[Am]         \brk
A \[Em]kingdom of iso\[C]lation\brk
And it \[D]looks like I'm the \[Asus4]queen    \[A]         \brk
\[Em]The wind is ho\[C]wling like this sw\[D]irling storm insid\[Asus4]e      \[Am]         \brk
\[Em]Couldn't keep it in\[D], heaven knows I've t\[A]ried\brk
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[D]Don't let them in, don't let them see  \[C]         \brk
Be the good girl you always have to be\[D]\brk
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them k\[C]now\brk
Well, now they \[Cadd9]know\brk
\endchorus
\beginchorus
Let it \[G]go, let it \[D/F#]go\brk
Can't \[Em7]hold it back any\[Cadd9]more\brk
Let it \[G]go, let it \[D/F#]go\brk
Turn a\[Em7]way and slam the \[Cadd9]door\brk
\[G]I don't ca\[D/F#]re what they're \[Em7]going to sa\[Cadd9]y\brk
Let the \[Bm7]storm rage o\[Bb]n\brk
The \[C]cold never bothered me anyway\brk
\[G]   \[D/F#]         \brk
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[Em]It's funny how some di\[C]stance makes ev\[D]erything seem sm\[Am]all\brk
And the \[Em]fears that once con\[D]trolled me can't \[Asus4]get to me at \[A]all\brk
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[D]It's time to see what I can do\[C]\brk
To test the limits and break \[D]through\brk
No right, no wrong, no rules for \[Cadd9]me\brk
I am free
\endchorus
\beginchorus
Let it \[G]go, let it \[D/F#]go\brk
I am o\[Em7]ne with the wind and s\[Cadd9]ky\brk
Let it \[G]go, let it \[D/F#]go\brk
You'll \[Em7]never see me \[Cadd9]cry\brk
\[G]Here I \[D/F#]stand and \[Em7]here I'll \[Cadd9]stay\brk
Let the \[Bm7]storm rage \[Bb]on      \[C]         \brk
\endchorus
\beginverse*{\nolyrics [Bridge]: 
\[C]My power flurries through the air into the ground\brk
\[C]My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around\brk
\[D]And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast\brk
\[Em]I'm never go\[C]ing back, the pa\[D]st is in the pa\[Am]st     \[C]         \brk
}\endverse
\beginchorus
Let it \[G]go, let it \[D/F#]go\brk
And I'll \[Em7]rise like the break of \[Cadd9]dawn\brk
Let it \[G]go, let it \[D/F#]go\brk
That \[Em7]perfect girl is \[Cadd9]gone\brk
\[G]Here I \[D/F#]stand in the\[Em7] light of \[Cadd9]day      \[Cm]         \brk
Let the \[Bm7]storm rage o\[Bb]n\brk
The \[C]cold never bothered me anyway\brk
