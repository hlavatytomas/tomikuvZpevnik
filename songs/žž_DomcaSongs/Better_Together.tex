\beginverse
\[C]There's no combina\[C/B]tion of words\brk
I could \[Am]put on the back of a \[Am/G]postcard\brk
\[F]No song that I \[C/E]could sing\brk
But \[Dm]I can try for \[G]your heart,\brk
\[C]Our dr\[C/B]eams, and they are mad\[Am]e out of real thing\[Am/G]s\brk
Like a \[F]shoe box of \[C/E]photographs\brk
With \[Dm]sepia-toned \[G]loving\brk
\[C]Love is the an\[C/B]swer\brk
At least for \[Am]most of the questions in \[Am/G]my heart like\brk
\[F]Why are we he\[C/E]re? And where do we go\[Dm]?\brk
And how come it's \[G]so hard?\brk
\[C]It's not always ea\[C/B]sy and\brk
Sometimes \[Am]life can be de\[Am/G]ceiving\brk
\[F]I'll tell you one th\[C/E]ing, it's always be\[Dm]tter when we're toge\[G]ther\brk
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[F]Mmmm, it's always be\[G]tter when we're together     \[F#]    \[F]         \brk
\[F]Yeah, we'll look at the st\[G]ars and we're together       \[F#]    \[F]         \brk
\[F]Well, it's always be\[G]tter when we're together     \[F#]    \[F]         \brk
\[F]Yeah, it's always be\[G]tter when we're together     \[F#]    \[F]         \brk
\[C] \[C/B]   \[Am]  \[Am/G]    \[F] \[C/E]   \[Dm]  \[G]         \brk
\endchorus
\beginverse
And all of these \[C]moments\brk
Just might \[C/B]find their way into my d\[Am]reams tonight\[Am/G],\brk
But I \[F]know that theyrsquo;l\[C/E]l be gone\brk
When the \[Dm]morning light \[G]sings\brk
And brings \[C]new things \[C/B]         \brk
For to\[Am]morrow night you \[Am/G]see\brk
That \[F]theyrsquo;ll be \[C/E]gone too,\brk
Too many \[Dm]things I have to \[G]do\brk
But if all of these \[C]dreams might find \[C/B]their way\brk
Into my \[Am]day to day scen\[Am/G]e\brk
I'd be \[F]under the imp\[C/E]ression\brk
I was \[Dm]somewhere in bet\[G]ween\brk
With only \[C]two,\brk
Just me and \[C/B]you,\brk
Not so many \[Am]things we got to \[Am/G]do\brk
Or \[F]places we got to \[C/E]be\brk
We'll sit be\[Dm]neath the mango \[G]tree, now\brk
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[F]Yeah, it's always be\[G]tter when we're together     \[F#]    \[F]         \brk
\[F]Mmmm, we're somewhere in\[G] between together            \[F#]    \[F]         \brk
\[F]Well, it's always be\[G]tter when we're together     \[F#]    \[F]         \brk
\[F]Yeah, it's always be\[G]tter when we're together     \[F#]    \[F]         \brk
\[C]Mmm mm\[C/B]m mm mm \[Am]mmm mm mm \[Am/G]mmm\brk
\[F]Mm mm mm mm\[C/E] mmm mmm\[Dm]m mm \[G]mmm\brk

\beginverse*{\nolyrics [Bridge]: 
\[Dm]I believe in memories t\[G]hey look so\brk
\[Dm]So pretty when I sleep h\[G]ey now and\brk
\[Dm]When I wake\[G] up you look so\brk
Pr\[Dm]etty sleeping next to me\[G] but there is\brk
\[F]Not enough time t\[G]here is no\brk
\[F]No song I could sing a\[G]nd there is no\brk
\[Dm/F]Combination of words I\[G] could say\brk
But I will \[Dm/F]still tell you one thing \[G]         \brk
