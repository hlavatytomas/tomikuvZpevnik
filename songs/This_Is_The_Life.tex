\beginverse
Oh, the \[Am]wind whistles down\brk
The \[F]cold dark street tonight\brk
And the \[C]people they were dancing\[Em] to the music vibe\brk
And the \[Am]boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair\brk
While the \[F]shy tormented youth sit way over there\brk
And the \[C]songs they get louder\brk
Each one better than be\[Em]fore\brk
\endverse
\beginchorus
And you're singing the s\[Am]ongs, thinking this is the life\brk
And you wake up in the \[F]morning and your head feels twice the size\brk
Where you gonna go? \[C]Where you gonna go?\brk
Where you gonna sleep to\[Em]night\brk
And you're singing the s\[Am]ongs, thinking this is the life\brk
And you wake up in the \[F]morning and your head feels twice the size\brk
Where you gonna go? \[C]Where you gonna go?\brk
Where you gonna sleep to\[Em]night\brk
Where you gonna sleep to\[Am]night\brk
 \[Am]    \[F]  \[C]  \[Em]         \brk
\endchorus
\beginverse
So you're \[Am]heading down the road in your taxi for four\brk
And you're \[F]waiting outside Jimmy's front door\brk
But \[C]nobody's in and nobody's home 'til\[Em] four\brk
So you're \[Am]sitting there with nothing to do\brk
Talking a\[F]bout Robert Riger and his motley crew\brk
And \[C]where you're gonna go and where you're gonna sleep to\[Em]night\brk
\endverse

And you're singing the s\[Am]ongs, thinking this is the life\brk
And you wake up in the \[F]morning and your head feels twice the size\brk
Where you gonna go? \[C]Where you gonna go?\brk
