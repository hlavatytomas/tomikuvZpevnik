\[Am]On a dark desert highway, c\[E7]ool wind in my hair\brk
\[G]Warm smell of colitas r\[D]ising up through the air\brk
\[F]Up ahead in the distance, I\[C] saw a shimmering light\brk
\[Dm]My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim\brk
\[E7]I had to stop for the night\brk
\[Am]There she stood in the doorway; I\[E7] heard the mission bell\brk
\[G]And I was thinking to myself\brk
This could be \[D]heaven or this could be hell\brk
\[F]Then she lit up a candle, a\[C]nd she showed me the way\brk
\[Dm]There were voices down the corridor,\brk
\[E7]I thought I heard them say...\brk

\[Am]So I called up the captain; P\[E7]lease bring me my wine (he said)\brk
\[G]We haven't had that spirit here since \[D]1969\brk

\[Am]Mirrors on the ceiling; th\[E7]e pink champagne on ice \brk
\[G]We are all just prisoners here, o\[D]f our own device\brk
\[F]and in the master's chambers, t\[C]hey gathered for the feast\brk
\[Dm]They stab it with their steely knives but they\brk
\[E7]just can't kill the beast\brk
\[Am]Last thing I remember, I was ru\[E7]nning for the door\brk
\[G]I had to find the passage back to the pl\[D]ace I was before\brk
