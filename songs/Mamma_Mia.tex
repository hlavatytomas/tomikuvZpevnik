\[D]I've been \[A/D]cheated by \[D]you, since I don't know \[G]when\brk
\[D]So I \[A/D]made up my \[D]mind, it must come to an \[G]end\brk
\[D]Look at me now, \[Daug]will I ever learn?\brk
\[D]I don't know ho\[Daug]w, but I suddenly \[G]lose control\brk
There's a fire with\[A]in my soul\brk
\[G]Just \[D/F#]one  \[A]look and I can hear a bell ring\brk
\[G]One \[D/F#]more \[A]look and I forget everything\brk

\[D]And when you go,\[Daug] when you slam the door\brk
\[D]I think you kno\[Daug]w, that you won't be a\[G]way too long\brk
You know that I'm \[A]not that strong\brk
